  <h1>My First Blog!</h1>
  <p>Hopefully this blog will become more detailed as my proficiency increases, but for now it remains pretty simple.<p>
  <p>I'm going to use this blog to track my progress, outline short and long term goals, and note some tips and tricks to help me succeed.<p>
  <p>
  <p><em><strong>WHY I AM NOW</strong></em><p>
    <p>When entering Skill Distillery, I didn't know much about coding. I ran into some of it at my previous two jobs, espcially as a QA tester.<p>
    <p>I wanted to continue with coding because I saw more of a future in it than QA - I was a good tester but I could see that I wouldn't really<p>
    <p>develop enough as a tester to satisfy my curiousity. Coding would use both sides of my brain, something I enjoyed doing as a tester.<p>
    <p>Basically I'm going to reach my goal of landing a good programming gig by working hard. It's a bit of a cliche but I think my greatest<p>
    <p>strength is my ability to put up with a bunch of crap better than most people.
  <p><em><strong>WHERE I AM NOW</strong></em><p>
    <p>After going through most of the Java The Hard Way book (planning on finishing it) I think I have a pretty loose grasp of the basics<p>
    <p>probably not enough to go rogue but enough to know how much I don't know. I'm ready to learn though!<p>
    <p>I haven't coded much beyond what has been coded in the book, but I hope someday to code an app idea I have - The Regular. It's kind of<p>
    <p>like an outsourced loyalty program that restaurants and bars can use to offer deals for repeat customers.
  <p><em><strong>SOME THINGS TO BE CAREFUL FOR</strong></em><p>
    <p>In the past I have tried to push through when I got stuck and probably wasted more time than I should grinding my gears. I'm going to<p>
    <p>try to be more proactive in asking for help when I get stuck. I am generally pretty good at not becoming too frustrated, but when I<p>
    <p>do get frustrated, I tend to get frustrated about technology stuff - I hated setting up tech settings for different QA platforms to<p>
    <p>only fail to get some APK to download. I'll try to keep my cool when some programming thing doesn't compile right.<p>
    <p>When I do get frustrated, I have to step away from what I'm working on for a bit - this helps me not only control my frustration but<p>
    <p>also helps me see a problem from a new angle. I sometimes have a tendancy to not always see the whole picture or to take for granted what<p>
    <p>is not true.<p>
